# Defect_detection_on_wood
This project trains a YOLOv8 model to detect knots, crack and hand-drawn X marks on images of reclaimed timber. These marks typically indicate defects like nails, staples, or unusual knots. The goal is to automate defect detection for digital fabrication and material reuse workflows.
